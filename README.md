3D printer that can be used in most frame sizes.


Nowadays, homemade methods of making products are becoming more and more popular. If something breaks, you donâ€™t have to look for a replacement, but make one. Previously, this was very difficult, and for this you had to go to the store or order it. Also, many may need small batches of goods for which it is not profitable to buy a machine for casting metal/plastic. This is where FFF 3D printing technology using layer-by-layer deposition technology comes to the rescue. Often, such cars are either cheap but slow, or fast but expensive. Also, there are almost no large-sized models.
